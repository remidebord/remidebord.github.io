If you want to come back to the &laquo;&nbsp;old&nbsp;&raquo; desktop in ubuntu, just install GNOME classic, with this command line:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback
```
Once, this is done, close the session, click on the gear icon near the user name and select gnome compiz or metacity. Open your session and voila !
