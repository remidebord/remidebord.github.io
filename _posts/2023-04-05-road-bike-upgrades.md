I consider my bike like a fellow traveler since i bought it in 2012 for 30€ at the used store, with one of my first wages.

This bike is a Profil 2 (PF2) manufactured by [Motobecane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motob%C3%A9cane) between 1981 and 1983 (one year before the bankruptcy). Bike reference is present in the [Motobecane 1981 catalog](../../../uploads/motobecane_catalog_1981.pdf), but the Profil 3 (version++) was prefered for the photo.

Here is the only picture that i found for this bike, extracted from some swedish catalog.

[![Motobecane profil 2](../../../uploads/bike/profil2-3.jpg)](../../../uploads/bike/profil2-3.jpg)

The frame is made of 1020 steel, tubes are brazed and have an aero shape which look pretty cool, but don't come from known manufacturers like [Reynolds](https://www.reynoldstechnology.biz/) or [Columbus](https://www.columbus1919.com/en/).
In theory the frame is not suited to my height (55cm frame for 175cm height), but i appreciate to cycle without caring if the front wheel will touch my shoes when i'm in a curve or a roundabount.

The Profil 2 integrate a mix of a [Shimano Adamas AX](https://velobase.com/ViewGroup.aspx?GroupID=81bf154e-483c-40ad-ac5c-cd77fc25ad59) group (brakes, crankset, bottom bracket, pedals), Huret parts (shifters, front and rear derailleurs), and some internal/unique Motobecane parts such as the handlebar, stem, headset, seatpost (aero) and the saddle (similar to a concor supercorsa, but way more cheap).   

I did the first modifications in 2012, which consist to remove the rusts (as there was a lot of it, even if not noticeable on the photos), and add an industrial primer with some spray paint ([MTN Hardcore 400ml - RV-16 Vert Pistache](https://www.allcity.fr/)) and varnish on top.

I removed the Shimano brakes lever, replaced by Dia Comp lever and changed those crappy brakes ([Shimano BR-AD20](https://velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=f317b268-5c78-45e2-8bf0-eeafc47d1ecc&Enum=117)) with the bad "parapul" system, by [Campagnolo Avanti](https://velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=9237511E-0213-4E30-B969-5A26EAD9E656&Enum=117&AbsPos=0) brakes, much more efficient and with standard pads.

One year after, i purchased new wheels (80€) from a [used bike part shop](https://www.briko-bike.com/fr/) as the initial ones were so old that it was not possible to straighten/true the bike wheels.

Purchased wheels are composed of Campagnolo hubs (no references), Wolber rims (Mavic nowadays), and a singlespeed freewheel ([Nervar](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/roue-libre-a-visser-1-vitesse/_/R-p-164794?mc=8389807)) on the rear wheel.
As the rear derailleur was no use i removed it, and i decided to also remove the shifters, and the front derailleur, which considerably reduced the maintenance time, and the bike weight.

I put tubular tyres (boyaux) from [Vittoria](https://www.vittoria.com/ww/en/) as the rims were planned for. After several disappointments with the Vittoria Rally i changed and picked the Vittoria Corsa Elite (700x23), paid 44.95€ the pack of two (yes, sounds impossible in 2023), and it changed my life.

The bike stayed in this configuration for around 8 years, brakes pads were changed periodically and the singlespeed freewheel was replaced in mid 2021 due a mechanism completely broken.

Nervar single speed freewheel (18 teeths) was replaced by a [Miche single speed freewheel](https://studiobrisant.com/en/miche-singlespeed-freilauf-ritzel-3mm-16-zaehne) (16 teeths, 1/2" X 1/8") which is in fact manufactured by the chinese company [CIxi Kangdi Bicycle Co](http://en.cnata.com/) specialized in it. At the same time the chain was replaced by a half link chain ([YBN MK918](https://studiobrisant.com/fr/ybn-singlespeed-fahrradkette-silber-1/2-1/8-bmx) ~15€) which permit to avoid the addition of a [chain tensioner](https://www.bike-components.de/fr/PAUL/Tendeur-de-Chaine-Melvin-Chain-Tensioner-p53572/).

In September 2022 i finally replaced my Vittoria tubular tyres, by [Continental Sprinter Gatorskin](https://www.continental-tires.com/fr/fr/b2c/bicycle/tires/sprinter-gatorskin.html)  (700x25) tubular tyres after a puncture. I choose them for two reasons, durability and price (48.98€ each), because in the meantime the price of the Vittoria Corsa Graphene (new reference) increased up to 80€ for each... Which sounds ridiculous compared to what i payed for my car (Michelin four seasons tyres at ~90€ each). Looks like tubular tyres are not popular nowadays, and abandonned for usual tyres (Gravel is the new hype). Even glue was hard to find, i used some [Jantex](https://amzn.eu/d/g3I2Bjn) tape (Velox) instead (~15€), as it was out of stock on every known online shops and at locals bike dealer shops.

One month later, back from work, i discovered a long crack at the bottom of the seat tube. After some hours spent to find a company able to perform such repair, i found [Baudou Bikes](http://baudou-bikes.com/) which is still doing handmade bicycles (steel only) and provides services like steel frames repairs. After a discussion with Gael, i decided to remove the paint in order to check if the frame was repairable.

After a complete disassembly and few hours later the paint was removed and it didn't look so bad. At least i didn't discover more than this crack.

[![Frame cracked](../../../uploads/bike/full/IMG_1254.JPG)](../../../uploads/bike/full/IMG_1254.JPG)

I used a stripper from [Blanchon](https://www.blanchon.com/professionnels/decapant-batiment-10-gelifie.html), combined to a hot air gun when the paint was not affected by the stripper.
It tooks around 3 hours to remove most of the paint and the primer with long pauses in between in order to let the stripper do it's work.
