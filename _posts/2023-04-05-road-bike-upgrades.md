I consider my bike like a companion since i bought it in 2012 for 30€ at the used store, with one of my first wages.

This bike is a Profil 2 (PF2) manufactured by [Motobecane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motob%C3%A9cane) between 1981 and 1983 (one year before the bankruptcy).

Bike reference is present in the [Motobecane 1981 catalog](../../../uploads/motobecane_catalog_1981.pdf), but the Profil 3 (version++) was prefered for the photo.

Here is the only picture that i found for this bike, extracted from some swedish catalog.

The frame is made of 1020 steel, tubes are brazed and have an aero shape which look pretty cool, but don't come from known manufacturers like [Reynolds](https://www.reynoldstechnology.biz/) or [Columbus](https://www.columbus1919.com/en/).
In theory the frame is not suited to my height (55cm frame for 175cm height), but i appreciate to cycle without caring if the front wheel will touch my shoes when i'm in a curve or a roundabount.

The Profil 2 integrate a mix of a [Shimano Adamas AX](https://velobase.com/ViewGroup.aspx?GroupID=81bf154e-483c-40ad-ac5c-cd77fc25ad59) group (brakes, crankset, bottom bracket, pedals), Huret parts (shifters, front and rear derailleurs), and some internal/unique Motobecane parts such as the handlebar, stem, headset, seatpost (aero) and the saddle (similar to a concor supercorsa, but way more cheap).   

I did the first modifications in 2012, which consist to remove the rusts (as there was a lot of it, even if not noticeable on the photos), and add an industrial primer with some spray paint ([MTN Hardcore 400ml - RV-16 Vert Pistache](https://www.allcity.fr/)) and varnish on top.

I removed the Shimano brakes lever, replaced by Dia Comp lever and changed those crappy brakes ([Shimano BR-AD20](https://velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=f317b268-5c78-45e2-8bf0-eeafc47d1ecc&Enum=117)) with the bad "parapul" system, by [Campagnolo Avanti](https://velobase.com/ViewComponent.aspx?ID=9237511E-0213-4E30-B969-5A26EAD9E656&Enum=117&AbsPos=0) brakes, much more efficient and with standard pads.

One year after, i purchased new wheels (80€) from a [used bike part shop](https://www.briko-bike.com/fr/) as the initial ones were so old that it was not possible to straighten/true the bike wheels.

Purchased wheels are composed of Campagnolo hubs (no references), Wolber rims (Mavic nowadays), and a singlespeed freewheel ([Nervar](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/roue-libre-a-visser-1-vitesse/_/R-p-164794?mc=8389807)) on the rear wheel.
As the rear derailleur was no use i removed it, and i decided to also remove the shifters, and the front derailleur, which considerably reduced the maintenance time, and the bike weight.

I put tubular tyres (boyaux) from [Vittoria](https://www.vittoria.com/ww/en/) as the rims were planned for. After several disappointments with the Vittoria Rally i changed and picked the Vittoria Corsa Elite (700x23), paid 44.95€ the pack of two (yes, sounds impossible in 2023), and it changed my life.

TODO.
