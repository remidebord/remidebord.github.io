I have my [Toyota Corolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla_(E120)) since 2020, and it's a pretty good/balanced car, with low maintenance (until now, only the tires and the brake pads were replaced).

Recently, one of the rear struts came to end of life and required a replacement.
My first though was to go to the Toyota garage, but when I saw the amount for the replacement it makes me hallucinate (776€, with 226€ for one strut...), because if you have to replace the two rear struts, parts are costing around 300€ (shock absorbers, springs, protections and cups), and it's Monroe parts, so good quality parts (not Bilstein high ends parts but it's not a racing car).

Here are the parts purchased:
- Shock absorbers (Monroe - [G21660](https://www.oscaro.com/jeu-de-2-amortisseurs-monroe-g21660-4076793-3539-p#/?vid=23273&vident=bSmUgc3VpcyBEaW9ueXNvc3JgwiGpe-6uOqI_Zqf_jFMngyaNAKPq_GUHLvrI93_4), 154€ for a pack of 2).
- Springs (Monroe - [SP3508](https://www.oscaro.com/jeu-de-2-ressorts-de-suspension-monroe-sp3508-2701671-188-p#/?vid=23273&vident=bSmUgc3VpcyBEaW9ueXNvc3JgwiGpe-6uOqI_Zqf_jFMngyaNAKPq_GUHLvrI93_4), 58€ for each spring).
- Protections (Monroe - [PK326](https://www.oscaro.com/kit-de-protection-contre-la-poussiere-amortisseur-monroe-pk326-6163139-919-p#/?vid=23273&vident=bSmUgc3VpcyBEaW9ueXNvc3JgwiGpe-6uOqI_Zqf_jFMngyaNAKPq_GUHLvrI93_4), 35€ for a pack of 2).
- Cups (Monroe - [MK294](https://www.oscaro.com/kit-de-butee-de-suspension-monroe-mk294-4389907-1180-p#/?vid=23273&vident=bSmUgc3VpcyBEaW9ueXNvc3JgwiGpe-6uOqI_Zqf_jFMngyaNAKPq_GUHLvrI93_4), 13€ x 2).

At the end, springs and protections were returned as original ones were in good conditions. 
Usually a spring is replaced when this one is broken or present some cracks. 

There is a good video explaining how to proceed for the replacement, see [Comment remplacer des amortisseurs arrière sur une TOYOTA COROLLA E120 TUTORIEL | AUTODOC](https://youtu.be/LApdLJzJ4Mk?si=QyeaerVrQRqx2olA).  

The procedure is also detailed in the Toyota Corolla [service manual](../../../uploads/9th-gen-toyota-corolla-zze130-service-manual-2003-2008.pdf) page 1255.

In my case, as I dont possess the tools (strut spring compressor, ...) and a car elevator, replacement was performed in a "[self garage](https://www.selfgarage.org/garages-par-departement/liste-garage-Tarn.html)" located in Rabastens, and it took us around 2h (40€).

The effective costs for the replacement was ~220€ (less than the price of a Toyota shock absorber...).

Thanks to Julien (self garage owner) for his precious help.

TODO: add pictures.

Note: unfortunately i don't have photos of the replacement.
